# Custom Extension for 3D Slicer
## LoadCTData Extension
LoadCTData is a custom tool for 3D Slicer developed in Python.

The LoadCTData extension enables users to upload NRRD files and perform manipulations such as rotations around the X, Y, and Z axes, as well as translations along these axes.

This extension has been developed with 3D Slicer version 5.6.2.
### Import LoadCTData extension in 3D Slicer
 
**Load the Extension**:
   - Open 3D Slicer.
   - Go to the "Edit" menu and choose "Application Settings".
   - In the Application Settings, navigate to the "Modules" section.
   - You will see an option to "Add" new module paths. Click on "Add" and select the folder containing the extension `/3Dslicer/CT-Wood/CTWood/LoadCTData`. 

**Restart 3D Slicer**:
   - Restart 3D Slicer to load the new extension. Ensure that the module path to the extension's folder is correctly set, so Slicer can recognize and load the extension.

**Verify the Extension**:
   - After restarting, check if the extension appears in the module drop-down menu or under the appropriate category in Slicer. This confirms that the extension is loaded.

## SinoReconsVisual Extension
SinoReconsVisual is a custom tool for 3D Slicer developed in Python.

Using SinoReconsVisual, you can:
* Load trajectory data (e.g., angles, table positions) along with the XML file into Slicer.
* Display metadata, including trajectory plots and a detailed view of metadata information.
* Interact with metadata by selecting between scans or choosing a subset of trajectory data.
* Display a subset of the sinogram.
* Create, import, or edit a geometry file.

This extension has been developed with 3D Slicer version 5.6.2.
